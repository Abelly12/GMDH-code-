# GMDH (Group Method of Data Handling) in MATLAB

## Overview

The GMDH (Group Method of Data Handling) approach is a powerful, self-organizing modeling technique, originating from the field of complex systems analysis. It is primarily used for predictive modeling and pattern recognition. GMDH is particularly beneficial for scenarios involving large datasets with complex, nonlinear relationships. This MATLAB implementation enables users to efficiently apply the GMDH methodology for predictive analytics, helping to uncover underlying patterns in the data that are not immediately obvious with traditional methods.

## Why Use GMDH?

GMDH is chosen for its ability to generate a model that not only fits the training data but also generalizes well to unseen data. Its polynomial neural network architecture allows it to excel in:
- Forecasting and time series prediction.
- Complex nonlinear function approximation.
- Feature extraction and data reduction in high-dimensional spaces.

The main advantages include:
- **Automated Model Selection**: GMDH can automatically select the optimal model complexity, thereby avoiding overfitting.
- **Scalability**: Handles large datasets and can scale with increasing data size.
- **Adaptability**: Can adapt to new data without complete retraining.

## How to Use the GMDH Code in MATLAB

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have MATLAB installed on your computer. No additional toolboxes are required for the basic functionality of GMDH, but the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox might be beneficial for pre-processing data and performance evaluation.

### Installation
1. Clone or download the GMDH MATLAB code from its repository.
2. Extract the files to a directory accessible by MATLAB.
3. Add the directory containing the GMDH code to your MATLAB path:
   ```matlab
   addpath('path_to_gmdh_folder');
   ```

### Usage

#### Data Preparation
Prepare your dataset in MATLAB. Data should be organized in a matrix where rows represent samples and columns represent features. The target variable (what you are trying to predict) should be in the last column.

#### Model Training
To train a GMDH model, use the main function provided in the code. You will need to specify training data and parameters for the model.

Example:
```matlab

% Load your data (example data matrix 'X' and target vector 'y')
load('yourdata.mat');

% Split data into training and testing (optional, for demonstration)
n = size(X, 1);
idx = randperm(n);
X_train = X(idx(1:floor(0.7*n)), :);
y_train = y(idx(1:floor(0.7*n)));

X_test = X(idx(floor(0.7*n)+1:end), :);
y_test = y(idx(floor(0.7*n)+1:end));

% Train GMDH model
model = gmdh_train(X_train, y_train);

% Predict using the GMDH model
predictions = gmdh_predict(model, X_test);

% Evaluate model
mse = mean((predictions - y_test).^2);
disp(['Mean Squared Error: ', num2str(mse)]);
```

#### Model Parameters
The `gmdh_train` function typically allows for several parameters to be set, such as the degree of the polynomial, the type of criterion for model selection , and maximum number of layers. Refer to the function's documentation for details on all parameters.

### Documentation
For more detailed documentation on the functions and their parameters, refer to the comments within the MATLAB files or any accompanying documents provided in the repository.
